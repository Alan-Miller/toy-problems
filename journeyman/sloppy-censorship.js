  SLOPPY CENSORSHIP
  https://www.codewars.com/kata/sloppy-censorship/train/javascript

  As the owner of a down-at-heel publishing firm, you're excited to have acquired the rights to minor celebrity's bawdy memoirs.

  You need to get them printed before the tabloids get wind of them, but you're worried they might be libellous.

  Write a function which acts on a string to obscure any word beginning with an uppercase letter by replacing each subsequent character with an underscore _.

  The initial capital letter should remain intact, as should all other uppercase letters in a word not normally capitalised. Therefore, anything in camelCase would not be censored, but brand names with InCapping (YouTube) will (Y__T__).

  As this is shoddy rush-job, you don't need to account for the capital letters which start a sentence, nor should you bother preventing punctuation like periods and possessives ('s, 're) from being replaced.
