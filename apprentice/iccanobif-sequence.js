    THE ICCANOBIF SEQUENCE
    https://www.codewars.com/kata/the-iccanobif-sequence/train/javascript

    Your task is to create an array of size n with the values of the Fibonnaci sequence, and reverse the order in which the sequence is displayed.

    For example: [1, 1, 2, 3, 5] would become [5, 3, 2, 1, 1]

    You can assume that n will always be a positive integer between and including, 1 and 64.

    Note: If you receive a server timeout - Check your code and re-run the tests.
